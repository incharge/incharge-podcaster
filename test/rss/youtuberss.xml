RECORDED ON OCTOBER 24th 2023.
Dr. Joanna Malinowska is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland. The subject of her research is a broadly understood philosophy of science, with particular emphasis on philosophy of medicine, philosophy of neurosciences and philosophy of psychology. She explores connections between these areas and questions in bioethics, epistemology, ontology, and methodology. Her current focus is on the conceptualization and use of ethnoracial categories in medicine.

In this episode, we first talk about cultural neuroscience. We then get into the concepts of race and ethnicity, their scientific validity, the idea of racialization, and studying differences between human populations. We discuss the consequences of racialized medical information, and what a postracial medicine could look like. Finally, we talk about empathy in human-robot interactions.

RECORDED ON OCTOBER 19th 2023.
Katarina Kovačević is a PhD candidate in the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University. Her main research interest is responsibility. She investigates how people ascribe responsibility for good and bad outcomes across various situations. She is specifically interested in epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance.

In this episode, we talk about epistemic responsibility and strategic ignorance. We start by discussing how to approach responsibility from the perspective of psychology/cognitive science, and when exactly people ascribe responsibility to others. We talk about epistemic responsibility, what happens when people lack relevant information, if the effort put into acquiring it matters, and if outcomes matter. Finally, we discuss strategic ignorance, and focus on health-related examples, particularly testing for STIs.

Dr. Suthan Krishnarajan is Associate Professor in Political Science at Aarhus University. His research agenda seeks to understand and explain political regime instability. Broadly speaking, a political regime is the rules that determine who can access power, and how, in a given country. In democracies, leaders are chosen in competitive, free, and fair elections; in autocracies, leaders access power through alternative means. In his research, he examines why such regimes sometimes endure and at other times break down. I do so from three traditional disciplines in political science: comparative politics, public opinion, and international relations.

In this episode, we talk about regime instability in democracies and autocracies. We start by defining democracy. We talk about how people form democratic support. We discuss if citizens in Western democracies support democracy, and how satisfied they are with it. We talk about when people support undemocratic behavior, and how they rationalize it. We discuss evidence-based interventions to improve citizens’ democratic values. We discuss if national elections are unequivocally good for people’s satisfaction with democracy. We talk about factors that lead to democratic breakdown, including economic crises. Finally, we discuss how autocratic leaders deal with regime instability and coup attempts.

RECORDED ON OCTOBER 17th 2023.
Dr. David Pinsof is a research scientist who received his PhD in Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. David’s research focuses on evolutionary psychology, political psychology, public opinion, and sexual behavior. His empirical work explores individual differences in mating psychology and their relation to political attitudes, mathematical models of alliance formation, and the origins of political belief systems.

In this episode, we start by talking about the alliance theory of political belief systems. We discuss common explanations of political belief systems, and their inconsistency; social dynamics, and how people form and maintain alliances; the Democratic/Republican divide in the US; and moral foundations theory, and moral systems. We discuss whether the meaning of life matters, and the motivations behind intellectual debates, including status-seeking. We talk about the link between morality and violence. Finally, we discuss social paradoxes, virtue-signaling, and self-deception.

RECORDED ON OCTOBER 13th 2023.
Dr. Liuba Papeo is a tenured researcher at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives &quot;Marc Jeannerod&quot; of Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), and Principal Investigator of the research program “THEMPO” funded by a European Research Council Starting Grant. She is a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience, with a M.Sc. Psychology. After her Ph.D. (2010, SISSA Trieste), she joined the Department of Psychology at Harvard University as a Marie-Curie postdoctoral fellow (2011-2013). She completed the postdoctoral research training at CIMeC, University of Trento (2013-2014). In 2015, she joined the CBC at University Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona funded by a Marie Curie Cofund program grant.

In this episode, we talk about social perception. We start by talking about what we pay attention to when we perceive other people, the kinds of information we get from faces, and facing-dyad perception. We discuss minimal social scenes, how we distinguish between interaction and non-interacting dyads, and how socially relevant spatial relations are represented visually. We talk about body-form and body-motion perception. We discuss how we represent social entities differently from their relations, and how we learn about the kind of relationship a particular dyad has. We talk about areas of the brain that process social information. Finally, we get into how we process information about nonhuman bipeds and quadrupeds.

RECORDED ON JANUARY 3rd 2024.
Dr. Luis Favela is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences (tenured) at the University of Central Florida. He is concurrently a Fellow in the Research Corporation for Science Advancement's Molecular Basis of Cognition Scialog program. His research attempts to understand mind (i.e., behavior, cognition, and consciousness) from a naturalistic and interdisciplinary perspective. He is the author of The Ecological Brain: Unifying the Sciences of Brain, Body, and Environment.

In this episode, we focus on The Ecological Brain. We first discuss ecological psychology, and neuroscience, how they split historically, and why it seems hard to reconcile them. We talk about two traditions in neuroscience: one focusing on biological features of neurons, and the other focusing on abstract features of neurons. We discuss complexity science. We get into Dr. Favela’s NExT (NeuroEcological Nexus Theory) framework, the hypotheses derived from it, and limitations of brain-centered approaches. We discuss what the ecological brain is. Finally, we talk about the main challenges to the NExT framework, non-mechanistic explanations, and the importance of interdisciplinarity.

Dr. Joshua Knobe is Professor of Philosophy, Linguistics and Psychology at Yale University. A lot of his recent research has been concerned with the impact of people’s moral judgments on their intuitions about questions that might initially appear to be entirely independent of morality (questions about intention, causation, etc.).

In this episode, we talk about topics in experimental philosophy. We discuss how experimental philosophy relates to science. We talk about the relationship between belief and knowledge. We discuss how norm violations interact with causal judgment. We talk about the “true self”, and how moral beliefs influence beliefs about the “true self”, and vice-versa. We discuss how people conceptualize happiness, and how they relate it to moral character. We talk about “folk morality”, and whether people tend to believe in objective moral truths. We discuss people’s philosophical intuitions, with a focus on free will, and how much they vary cross-culturally. We discuss what explains the different views of philosophers, and if they stem from individual differences in cognition. We talk about how moral judgments influence intuitions in folk psychology, and we discuss whether moral judgments influence the production of scientific knowledge. Finally, we discuss if the way people interact socially influences how they construe truth, and if political polarization changes our understanding of truth.

RECORDED ON JULY 18th 2023.
Dr. Cailin O’Connor is Professor in the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at UC Irvine. She is a philosopher of biology and behavioral sciences, philosopher of science, and evolutionary game theorist. Her monograph The Origins of Unfairness was published in July 2019 by Oxford University Press. She is the author of Games in the Philosophy of Biology, and The Misinformation Age.

In this episode, we start by talking about game theory, and what we can study through it. We then talk about social pressure, conformity, conservativism, and selection in science. We discuss if scientific retraction works. We talk about perpetual categories, and if they have evolved to track properties of the world. We discuss learning generalization, and evolutionarily stable strategies. Finally, we talk about misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dr. Darcia Narvaez is a Professor of Psychology Emerita at the University of Notre Dame. She has written extensively on issues of character and moral development. Dr. Narvaez’ research explores questions of species-typical and species-atypical development in terms of wellbeing, morality, and sustainable wisdom. She examines how early life experience (the evolved nest) influences moral functioning and wellbeing. 
Dr. Gay A. Bradshaw is a psychologist and ecologist, and director of The Kerulos Center for Nonviolence. Her work focuses on animal trauma recovery and wildlife self-determination. She is the author of Elephants on the Edge: What Animals Teach Us about Humanity, an award-winning book on PTSD in elephants.
They are both authors of The Evolved Nest: Nature's Way of Raising Children and Creating Connected Communities.

In this episode, we focus on The Evolved Nest. We start by discussing what an “evolved nest” is. We talk about mothers and allomothers; the importance of physical contact; the role of elders and fathers; attachment theory; children’s needs; and the impact of early life experiences. We discuss the effects of individualistic values in modern industrialized societies. Finally, we talk about what we can learn from traditional societies and non-human animals.

RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 28th 2023.
Dr. Merlijn Olthof is a Post-Doc in Tipping points in Treatment at the University of Groningen, and Lecturer in Pedagogical Sciences at Radboud University. His work focuses on complex systems, clinical psychology, developmental psychopathology, and related topics.

In this episode, we talk about a complex systems approach to psychopathology. We first talk about the study of behavioral variability within individuals, and some conceptual foundations of a complex systems approach to psychopathology, like critical fluctuations, destabilization, and order transitions. We discuss the study of early warning signals, and some of its limitations. We talk about large shifts in symptom severity. We discuss the differences between group-based “disease models” and personalized approaches inspired by complex systems theory. We talk about psychopathology as emergent and self-organized. Finally, we discuss implications for the classification of mental disorders and public health.

RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 29th 2023.
Dr. Gregory Radick is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds. He has held fellowships from the British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust, and served as President of the British Society for the History of Science (2014‒16) and the International Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology (2019‒21). He writes and lectures frequently for general audiences, and has appeared on BBC Radio 4’s In Our Time and in the PBS/National Geographic television series Genius with Stephen Hawking. In 2022 he was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Science Museum Group. He is the author of several books, including Disputed Inheritance: The Battle over Mendel and the Future of Biology.

In this episode, we focus on Disputed Inheritance. We start by talking about the work of Mendel, how it relates to Darwin’s, and also the work of Francis Galton on heredity. We then talk about how people first took Mendel’s work seriously, and the work and debate between William Bateson and Walter Weldon. We also discuss the aftermath of Weldon’s death in 1906. We talk about a Weldonian course that ran at the University of Leeds in 2013. Finally, we discuss whether Weldon’s approach to genetics connects in any way to the idea of the extended evolutionary synthesis.

RECORDED ON SEPTEMBER 27th 2023.
Dr. Naomi de Ruiter is Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Groningen. In her current research, she is inspired by critical psychology and discursive psychology in her attempt to study the ontology or process mechanisms of self and identity (and related concepts) as situated in time and context. In much of her research, she adopts a complex dynamic systems approach for micro-genetic or theoretical work. She is the author, together with Paul van Geert, of Toward a Process Approach in Psychology: Stepping into Heraclitus' River.

In this episode, we focus on Toward a Process Approach in Psychology. We talk about the dominant substance ontology approach in psychology, and an alternative process approach. We discuss dynamical systems theory, and how science is done. We talk about the study of self-esteem. We discuss the use of “representative samples”; intervention causality, and randomized controlled trials; the measurement problem in psychology; and how to deal with variability. Finally, we talk about how a process approach can reframe the way we think about the replication crisis in psychology.
